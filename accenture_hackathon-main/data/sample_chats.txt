Customer: "Hi, I’m really frustrated. Your smart home app crashes every time I try to connect my older thermostat model. It worked fine on my old phone!"
Agent: "Hello! I apologize for the trouble. Could you confirm your phone model and app version?"
Customer: "iPhone 15, app version 5.2.1. The thermostat is Model HT-2019."
Agent: "Thank you for clarifying. Unfortunately, HT-2019 isn’t supported in versions after 5.0. We can roll back your app to 4.9 or offer a discount on a compatible thermostat. What works best for you?"
Customer: "I’ll take the discount, but this is disappointing."
Agent: "Understood. I’ll email the discount code shortly. We appreciate your patience!"

Customer: "Good morning! I’m having an issue where my app keeps saying ‘no internet connection,’ but my Wi-Fi is working fine. Other apps load normally."
Agent: "Hi! Thanks for contacting us. Let’s check the app’s network permissions. Go to Settings > Apps > [App Name] > Permissions. Is ‘Local Network’ enabled?"
Customer: "Hmm, it was off! I just turned it on, but still no luck."
Agent: "No worries! Please clear the app cache: Settings > Storage > Clear Cache. Then log in again. Does that help?"
Customer: "That fixed it! Thank you! Any idea why this happened suddenly?"
Agent: "Glad to hear it! A recent update may have reset permissions. We’ll flag this to our dev team. Cheers!"
