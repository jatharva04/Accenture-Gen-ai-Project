 # AI Support Chat Analyzer

This is a multi-agent GenAI web application built using Streamlit and Python. It analyzes customer support chats and automates the process of summarizing the issue, identifying key actions, recommending resolutions, routing the issue to the right team, and estimating resolution time.

## Problem Statement

Manual customer support workflows cause delays, inconsistent resolutions, and inefficient ticket routing. This project uses lightweight local LLMs to automate and improve these processes.

## Features

- Summarizes customer-agent conversations
- Extracts action items like follow-ups or escalations
- Suggests possible resolutions
- Routes issues to the appropriate team
- Estimates resolution time

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Streamlit
- Ollama with Mistral model
- Regex for dataset parsing
- Local runtime (no external API calls)
